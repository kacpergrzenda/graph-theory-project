# Project: Graph Theory 2021

**Student ID: G00373427

## About the Project
This project allows a user to search through a text file (.txt) using a [regular expression](#regular-expression) and outputs the matching lines of the file to the regular expression. The file path, file name and regular expression are input into the command line as command line arguments, which then the regular expression gets turned into a NFA which is used to search through the file and output the matching file lines to the regular expression.

## General Info
#### Regular Expression
A regular expression is a group of letters, numbers or special characters that specify a special pattern. This pattern can be used to find a specific sequence of letters or numbers in a file by using an algorithm (like this one coded or more of an advanced algorithm). Regular Expressions are useful for filtering which make them very flexible and [adaptable](https://www.softwaretestinggenius.com/rehearsal-of-qtp-in-1-hr-interview-questions-31-40/) for many projects. More details about Regular expression can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).
